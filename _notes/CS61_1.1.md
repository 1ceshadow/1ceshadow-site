>The fundamental equation of computers is:
        $computer = powerful + stupid$
  Computers are very powerful, looking at volumes of data very quickly. Computers can perform billions of operations per second, where each operation is pretty simple.
  Computers are also shockingly stupid and fragile. The operations that they can do are extremely rigid, simple, and mechanical. The computer lacks anything like real insight ... it's nothing like the HAL 9000 from the movies. If nothing else, you should not be intimidated by the computer as if it's some sort of brain. It's very mechanical underneath it all.
  Programming is about a person using their real insight to build something useful, constructed out of these teeny, simple little operations that the computer can do.
                                —Francisco Cai and Nick Parlante, Stanford CS101

计算机的基本等式是：计算机=强大+愚蠢 计算机非常强大，可以快速处理大量数据。 计算机每秒可以执行数十亿次操作，而每次操作都非常简单。 计算机也非常愚蠢和脆弱。 它们所能进行的操作极其死板、简单和机械。 电脑缺乏真正的洞察力......与电影中的 HAL 9000 完全不同。 如果不出意外，你不应该被电脑吓倒，把它当成某种大脑。 编程是一个人利用自己的真知灼见，通过计算机所能进行的这些微小、简单的操作，构建出一些有用的东西。
