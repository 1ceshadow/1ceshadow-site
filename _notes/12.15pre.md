The food that is close to my heart is yellow cake, a northern speciality. It is especially important in my hometown Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province. In my hometown, almost every family makes it, not only as a daily food, but also essential for major festivals. It can be made in various ways, deep fried, dipped in sugar, and made into bean paste filling. It tastes soft and chewy. Coming Shenzhen, I always seemming have a feeling of hunger. But if I eat a piece of yellow cake, to exaggerate, I will not be hungry for all day.

我心心念念的食物是黄糕，一款北方的特产。尤其在我的家乡河北张家口有着特殊的地位。在我们那儿，几乎家家户户都要制作，不仅是日常的食物，过年过节更是必不可少的。它做法多样，可以油炸，可以蘸糖,可以做成豆沙馅。尝起来软、筋道、香。在这边，我总是有种饥饿感。但如果，吃上一块黄糕，夸张点说，一天都不饿。
